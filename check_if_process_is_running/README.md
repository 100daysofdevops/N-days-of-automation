# Check If a Process Is Running Bash Script

This Bash script provides a quick and easy way to check if a process is running on a Linux system. The script checks whether a specified process is currently running and returns a success message if the process is running, or an error message if it is not.

## Getting Started
To use the script, simply clone or download the script_to_check_if_process_is_running_v1.sh or script_to_check_if_process_is_running_v2.sh(updated version) file to your Linux system. You can then run the script by executing the following command:

```
bash script_to_check_if_process_is_running_v2.sh PROCESS_NAME
```
Replace PROCESS_NAME with the name of the process you want to check.

## Prerequisites
The script requires Bash to be installed on your Linux system.

## Usage
To use the script, simply run the command with the process name you want to check as an argument, like so:

```
bash script_to_check_if_process_is_running_v2.sh nginx
```

If the process is running, the script will output a success message indicating that the process is running. If the process is not running, the script will output an error message indicating that the process is not running.
